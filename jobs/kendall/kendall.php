<p>This project illustrates the dangers of buying unfamiliar materials late in the project cycle. By the time we got a P.O., the walls were being built and we had to figure out a way to anchor these trim pieces to the brick.  Had we been involved earlier, we would have tweaked the brick slightly and been able to bear on a brick, simplifying installation.</p>";
