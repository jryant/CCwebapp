<h3>Knowledge and Commercial Construction</h3>

<p>This is a rough draft; initially titled “Thinking out Loud” and intended to further develop
thoughts that were expressed in the <a href="index.php?page=writings_forum">Procurement presentation</a>. Specifically, I was asking myself how we could get to a point where relevant knowledge was less
fragmented, less scattered around. The notes sections are incomplete, but overall this is current.</p>
