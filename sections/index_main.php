<p><b>HOW?</b> &mdash; By getting the project done right, and on schedule.
<br><b>HOW?</b> &mdash; By maintaining a network of knowledgeable people and companies.
<br><b>HOW?</b> &mdash; By asking questions to be sure we understand what we are doing.
<br><b>HOW?</b> &mdash; By paying a lot of attention to your project and adding value.</p>

<p>Our name reflects our history. In addition to various concrete products, we also use the above approach to providing information <a href=\"index.php?page=services\">services</a>.</p>

<p>In our traditional role, we are a \"virtual manufacturer\" or \"virtual subcontractor\" supplying, and sometimes also installing, various molded architectural products for commercial construction projects. In semiconductors, we would be called a \"fabless manufacturer\", as we do not own fabrication facilities, but take responsibility for the product and for its design and sales. We outsource fabrication, installation, etc., utilizing a network of screened, regular high-end partners, each with a particular specialty.  The close supervision of each project by a senior project manager, <a href=\"Schlosberg, Leo Resume.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Leo Schlosberg</a>, provides the distinctive flavor of the Cary Concrete Products experience.  You always have someone working on your behalf to see your project through to completion.  Our experience with a wide range of related molded <a href=\"index.php?page=materials\">materials</a> gives us unusually broad expertise and allows us to recommend a particular material without prejudice. We can also provide multiple materials on a single project.  Our favorite projects are between $50,000 and $1,000,000.  Sometimes we supply F.O.B. jobsite, sometimes we install.</p>

<p>We are particularly knowledgeable in</p>
<ul>
	<li>Renovation/restoration</li>
	<li>Ornamental bridge elements</li>
	<li>Large planters (sidewalk, medians, etc.)</li>
	<li>Design-build (we often work to a GMP)</li>
	<li>Miscellaneous non-standard structural elements, including replacing cast-in-place with precast.</li>
</ul>

<p>We include a partial listing of <a href=\"index.php?page=jobs\">past jobs</a> because we are proud and wish to demonstrate all the pleased customers and the wide range of successful projects.</p>

<p>We do very little residential work.  Our typical geographic focus is Chicago and the surrounding 200 mile radius. On renovation work, we will bid a full scope, intended to be sure the general contractor does not get nasty surprises or material that is contractually correct but still a problem.  In renovation work we typically take full responsibility for existing dimensions in our scope, having found that there are fewer problems when we do all field measuring.</p>
<p>We believe that as a specialized, expert supplier of custom, job-specific material, we must provide advice along with the material, whether it involves connections, surrounding materials, installation sequencing or materials. We strive for trouble-free projects. We are focused on \"getting it right\" and have the know-how and commitment to consistently achieve this.</p>

<p>When we are providing <a href=\"index.php?page=services\">services</a> for a construction project, we take a similar approach.  At a certain stage in projects, when either the contractor or designer requires serious, knowledge-based attention to material decisions and to details, we work on a fee-basis, and may or may not also supply material.</p>

<p>Years ago, we produced a <a href=\"index.php?page=book\">coloring book</a> that beautifully and humorously covers many of the materials on which we focus. Check it out.</p>

<p>Leo Schlosberg has also done some reflective <a href=\"index.php?page=writings\">writing,</a> particularly on the role of knowledge in commercial construction.</p>
