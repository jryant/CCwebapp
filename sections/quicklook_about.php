<h2>What is Quick Look?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Fast, low-cost way for an owner or contractor to get an opinion on the cause and possible remedies for precast concrete that has issues of appearance and/or soundness. See <a href="#">below</a> for other materials.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="header">How does it work?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>You send us a few words and a few photos (must be good and of a certain type <a href="#">details</a>)</li>
	<li>We respond, sometimes with our analysis, sometimes first with questions or directions for more photos and then the analysis.</li>
	<li>Written analysis briefly addresses likely causes and likely progression if no action is taken, possible solutions, and next steps for you to consider.</li>
	<li>Your  report will be emailed to you as an attached pdf file. No hard copy will be sent. The QuickLook service does not include substantial followup to the report.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="header">How fast?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>After we receive payment and photos, we will <em>usually</em> respond in 24-48 hours. We take no action prior to payment. We will not look at your photos without payment.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="header">How much?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>$125 (PayPal account, credit card via PayPal, or mail us a check.)</li>
	<li>No invoicing option is offered for this service.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="header">What about cast-in-place concrete and other materials?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Our core (and very deep) expertise is architectural precast concrete. We have moderate knowledge of masonry and cast in place concrete as well as all types of precast. We are willing to look at problems in those areas on the same basis but we are clear that we have less expertise there. We have noted that it is sometimes difficult for people to distinguish between materials. In virtually every case we can confidently identify the material and have a general idea of what's causing the problem.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Quick Look FAQ</h1>

<h2>What if you can't tell anything from the photos?</h2>
<p>Most likely I will ask you to provide more and/or better photos. If I can't give you a likely diagnosis, then you know more – you know it's an uncommon problem. Or it may turn out that the material is not what you thought it was – you still know more. There are no refunds under any circumstances.</p>

<h2>Does your company do repair work?</h2>
<p>Our onsite work is typically within about a 150-mile radius of Chicago. We will consider going anywhere to evaluate a structure and assist in evaluating options.</p>

<h2>Will you recommend a contractor?</h2>
<p>On rare occasions we will offer to quote the work ourselves. The &quot;next steps&quot; in our analysis may include identifying the type of contractor we think is best suited to doing the work.</p>

<h2>What qualifies you to offer this service?</h2>
<p>In addition to years of experience looking at aged concrete, I have done significant reading of both trade and technical literature. And I am blessed with the ability to think clearly about such matters. Feel free to read our blog or other writings.</p>

<h2>Why do you charge more if my problem is widespread and I want to send more than 10 pictures?</h2>
<p>You are paying for the time it takes me to review, analyze, and write the findings. More pictures take more time to study and usually if more pictures are required to communicate the problem, then the problem is more complex.</p>

<h2>What if we want you to look at our problem in greater depth?</h2>
<p>If I feel I have appropriate knowledge we can do T&amp;M or we can mutually define a scope which could then be quoted on a lump sum basis.</p>
