<p><a href="http://caryconcrete.com/Schlosberg,%20Leo%20Resume.pdf">Leo Schlosberg</a>, the principal of Cary Concrete, provides specific services to construction-related companies. His dual background in construction and in information technology provides value in software-related projects. Strong product and material knowledge and neutral position (independence from specific products and specific manufacturers) bring value to construction projects. A long track record of successful projects in construction and information technology means you get focused results on internal business projects. Deep experience with construction documents (within a narrow arena of products and materials) means that you get quick, cost-effective results on services pertaining to a specific construction project.</p>

<p>Note: product and material related services are limited to the few materials we know. See the <a href="index.php?page=materials">materials</a> pages for details.</p>

<h3>SERVICES TO CONTRACTORS</h3>

<p><u>Information technology:</U> In terms of owner satisfaction, construction projects are typically much more successful than software projects. Partial or total failure is common in the custom software arena, with failure to understand or articulate requirements being the most common root cause. Construction is a more mature industry, and architects are trained to well understand the needs of their clients. That is less often the case when custom software is built, or even when off-the-shelf software is purchased. Having someone involved who understands both your business and technology is the best insurance against wasting your precious resources.</p>

<p><u>Materials and products:</u> A general contractor cannot have expertise on the 1000's of items involved in a typical commercial construction project. Sometimes, it is worth investing a small amount of money in getting a particular aspect of a project off to a good start by getting us involved. In design-bid-build projects, either during bidding or during construction, you may face a confusing situation in which the specs and plans seem open to wildly varying interpretations, or where it seems unclear which sub or supplier is appropriate, and which is clueless. In design-build or during shop drawing preparation, one may want the input of a knowledgeable and disinterested party, rather than relying solely on suppliers and subs.</p>

<p><u>Internal Projects:</u> When contractors seek to improve their office operations, they often find internal staff to lack time or expertise to make change as quickly as management would like. External resources like us can assist in various aspects of workflow or business process redesign, procedural analysis, etc. Often the major focus of such projects goes beyond incremental office productivity gains and addresses the business-critical issues of the flow of project information. A single lost drawing change or misinterpreted spec can cost more than can be saved through focus solely on productivity.</p>

<h3>SERVICES TO ARCHITECTS</h3>
<p>We all know it is impossible for a firm to have detailed expertise on the 1000's of products that get assembled into a commercial structure. Every specialist contractor or supplier finds that is a rare project with construction documents that make perfect sense to them; typically the documents are full of errors, conflicts, and mis-applied specs and details. Most of us know that architects must fight to get adequate fees for all the work they have to do. However, investing in a material-specific review of the specifications and drawings for a project can make that aspect go smoother for everyone and provide benefits to the architect. Upfront value engineering can be performed, architect's subtle but real costs for their involvement in disputes and problems is reduced, claims for extras are reduced or eliminated, and major potential liabilities are reduced.</p>

<h3>SERVICES TO SPECIALTY FABRICATORS</h3>
<p>Cary Concrete has never been a manufacturer; Cary has always performed contractually as a supplier and/or subcontractor. This has meant that we have put intensive effort into the "office" (sales, estimating, project management, shop drawing preparation, general administration) portion of a fabricator's full basket of headaches. Another view: Cary has always been an information company; information comes in, we evaluate and transform it, information goes out to drive the manufacturing and installation process. We have invested heavily in databases and other information technologies. We always have an enviable track record of avoiding conflict-ridden jobs and jobs that go bad; this is the result of great attention to "paperwork". This expertise is available to you, either in the context of your efforts involving software or changing business process or of a specific job that needs extra attention.</p>
